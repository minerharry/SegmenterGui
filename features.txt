convenient keyboard shortcuts
-up/down for brush size
-ctrl/shift for add/remove
-left/right to switch images
-ctrl+Scroll for zoom in/outline
-space to show/hide mask

buttons and widgets:
-fg/bg brush toggle, updates when shortcut is pressed
-brush size slider & number input, updates when shortcut is pressed
-some sort of image browser, updates w/ shortcut
-zoom in/out buttons
-"revert mask" button - with confirmation window, undoes all working changes and reverts to original 
-revert to original mask button

mask folders
-working folder (internal to the program)
-import masks to folder
-export masks to other folder

background/foreground color&alpha
-outline/area mode (more technically challenging)

cache/save-some, save-all
-navigation should feel smooth and fast (same ideaas the shortcuts)
--thought: have the images in batches of n (5-10); alway have loaded the current, next, and previous batch
--probably not needed; keep idea around in case image loading becomes a significant time sink


Datapane Requirements:
-select input image directory
--image browser? scrollpane: can select specific image with click, and displays current image
-select mask directory [empty or otherwise]
--no preview
-Mask directory works like an import, but still connected to the original directory; 
--Working mask directory, part of the internal program: all masks saved temporarily, to either be exported or discarded
--When mask directory changed/added, user is prompted that it will overwrite current files, with options:
---overwrite masks - working directory is cleared, and the new masks are loaded in
----[backend is just that working directory is cleared and masks will be pulled from the given directory]
---load masks but save changes - working directory is left as-is; any unmodified masks prioritize directory
----backend: working directory not cleared
----Should this be allowed? might be simpler not to, since main purpose is modification not creation
---cancel - does nothing

-Application close/open: when closing, given the option to export as well as to clear working masks
--json file stored in the working mask directory with the image directory and mask directory so work can resume
--possibly ability to save/load this json file as well, storing and loading sessions?

--brightness adjust - show user a histogram to allow for informed clamping
--export- change file format
--creation of new masks; allow for original-less mask saving


more difficult/advanced features:
-select specific area of image to "focus" on in terms of brightness autoscaling
-drag to resize panes
keyboard shortcut settings / config file
-might not be super necessary
fill tool - all contiguous area [of fg/bg]
