convenient keyboard shortcuts
-up/down for brush size
-ctrl/shift for add/remove
-left/right to switch images
-ctrl+Scroll for zoom in/outline
-space to show/hide mask

buttons and widgets:
-fg/bg toggle, updates when shortcut is pressed
-brush size slider & number input, updates when shortcut is pressed
-some sort of image browser, updates w/ shortcut
-zoom in/out buttons
-revert to original mask button

mask folders
-working folder (internal to the program)
-import masks to folder
-export masks to other folder

background/foreground color&alpha
-outline/area mode (more technically challenging)

cache/save-some, save-all
-navigation should feel smooth and fast (same ideaas the shortcuts)
--thought: have the images in batches of n (5-10); alway have loaded the current, next, and previous batch

Datapane Requirements:
-select input image directory
--image browser? scrollpane: can select specific image with click, and displays current image
-select mask directory [empty or otherwise]
--no preview
-possibly: save/load feature where instead of real-time edit, you can save a whole batch of masks?

more difficult/advanced features:
-drag to resize panes
keyboard shortcut settings / config file
-might not be super necessary
fill tool - all contiguous area [of fg/bg]
